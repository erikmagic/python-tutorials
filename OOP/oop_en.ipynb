    "In the previous workshops, we looked at functions. Now we expand on this concept by proposing objects. Objects are the \"active\" part of a class. Objects will include functions but might also include attributes which are variables assigned to the specific object. In a sense, objects are more general than functions. Objects will allow you to program more complicated code as functions are generally short and do only one thing. An object might contain numerous methods which does different things.  \n",
    "Objects are also portable in a way as they are self-contained piece of code with limited dependencies on the outer code. In other words, objects include much of the necessary code as own methods and attributes. As mentioned above, an object generally include attributes and methods.\n",

    "3. The `Vehicle` class is the _parent_ class of `Bicycle` and `Car`, i.e. these two classes are\n",
    "    actually `Vehicle` -- and therefore offers the full functionality of `Vehicle` -- but with more\n",
    "    methods or attributes. In addition, the two classes inheriting from `Vehicle` _ override the `move` method of the class\n",
    "    `Vehicle` (in our case).\n",
